ContextBrokerWebClient
======================

web client library for getting data from FIWARE Context Broker / Orion NGSI implementation

note that there is better code for this in the manual: https://forge.fi-ware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/Publish/Subscribe_Broker_-_Orion_Context_Broker_-_User_and_Programmers_Guide#JavaScript

this is just a quick port of our previous POI integration to get started.
